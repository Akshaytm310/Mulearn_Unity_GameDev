# Installing Unity and Exploring
## Project Name
AkshayTManoj
## Unity Version USed
Unity 6.3 (6000.3.2f1)

## First Impression 
My initial experience with Unity 6 has been very enjoyable. The interface feels clean, well-structured, and intuitive, making navigation easy even for beginners. Unity has a great balance between being powerful and beginner-friendly. Unity has definitely sparked my curiosity to explore more features and start building interactive experiences.

In the Scene View, the default setup includes the Camera and Directional Light. The Project Window neatly organizes essential asset folders such as Scenes, Settings, and InputSystem. This presents a workspace that’s ready for development. I was easily able to add a cube and manipulate it into a rectangular screen.

I want to explore Unity more in the coming future
